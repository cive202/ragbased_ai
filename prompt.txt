I am teaching OpenGL in my OpenGL course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, and the text at that time:

[{"title":"Unknown","number":"N\/A","start":170.16,"end":181.04,"text":" So the main issue that arises from depth buffers is called z-fighting and it occurs because two or more triangles have the same depth buffer and does the depth function."},{"title":"Unknown","number":"N\/A","start":7.76,"end":16.64,"text":" You might remember that we've already made use of the depth buffer in the going 3D tutorial in order to fix a weird issue we had."},{"title":"Unknown","number":"N\/A","start":25.04,"end":35.6,"text":" Now what this buffer basically does is that it stores depth values that represent how far away from the near plane of the projection matrix a certain fragment is."},{"title":"Unknown","number":"N\/A","start":75.84,"end":78.88,"text":" Now the cool part, let's visualize the depth buffer."},{"title":"Unknown","number":"N\/A","start":0.0,"end":7.76,"text":" In this tutorial we'll have a look at the depth buffers in OpenGL and also see how we can make use of them for a little graphical effect."}]

User asked the question: "where is depth buffer taught?
"

Answer in a human-friendly way, guiding the user to the specific video(s) and timestamps where the content is taught.
If unrelated to the course, say you can only answer course-related questions.
Answer in points. Each point must contain timestamps in **bold**.
